## Data availability

Raw structural MRI data are not publicly available due to ethical and privacy restrictions and the absence of participant consent for open sharing.

To support reproducibility, de-identified derived data (e.g., analysis-ready feature matrix and relevant metadata needed to reproduce the results) will be deposited in a public repository (DOI/URL: TBA).

Access to raw MRI data may be considered for non-commercial research purposes upon reasonable request to the corresponding author and approval by the local ethics committee, subject to a data use agreement.
